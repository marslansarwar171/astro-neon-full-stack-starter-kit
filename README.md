[Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Neon](https://neon.tech/) make a great combination. This Starter Kit includes all the basics you need to build a full-stack application using Astro and Neon Postgres Database.

## What is Astro?
If you've had your ear to the ground this year in the JavaScript world, you've heard a lot about Astro,
and there's good reason for it. *It's awesome.*

It's an all-in-one web framework for building blazing-fast content-focused websites.
Now they've pushed the boundaries even of that. You can build pretty much every full-stack app you want with it. 
So, you get the speed and simplicity of a basic static site generator (SSG). And by default, it ships zero JavaScript to the browser.

You can use any framework you want. It's UI agnostic.
So you can use React, Vue, Svelte, or whatever you want to build UI. It's up to you. Astro is amazing. You can create anything using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without using any frameworks mentioned above.

Everything gets zero client-side JavaScript by default. You can then hydrate individual components that need interactivity with a little attribute. ***Also, don't forget about Astro View Transitions. It's the coolest thing about Astro.***

<mark>With the introduction of Astro actions, it has gone to another level.</mark>

## What is Neon?
> "Ship faster with Postgres. The database you love, on a serverless platform designed to help you build reliable and scalable applications faster." [Source](https://neon.tech/)

Here is a list of features widely discussed about Neon:
- **Scaling:** Autoscaling according to load.
- **Branching:** Branch data and schema to instantly access isolated db copies.
- **Integration:** - Integrate it into framework or language of your choice.
- **Lightning Fast:** - Neon Serverless driver is designed for fast Queries over HTTP.
- **Database Ops:** - Programmatically manage thousands of databases.
